# weather-website

Basic web app for retrieving the weather at any location, deployed at https://jxu-weather-application.herokuapp.com/.

Was made for learning fundamentals of Nodejs.

Uses data from mapbox.net and darksky.net, converting a query location into a coordinate then retrieving the weather at that coordinate.

Web site is made using Handlebars.
